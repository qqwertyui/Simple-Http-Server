Shttps - Simple HTTP/1.1 server (It has nothing to do with https or shttp protocol hah)

About:
It is very simple HTTP server which can be used to serve static files (that is .html files or some blobs).
For now server can send few error codes if something goes wrong, those are:
- 200 OK
- 400 Bad Request
- 404 Not Found
- 405 Method Not Allowed
- 500 Internal Server Error
- 505 HTTP Version Not Supported

1. Requirements:
- bazel
- g++ with c++17 support
- glog*
- gflags*
* - these are downloaded by bazel but I thought it's worth to mention about them.

2. Build:
- git clone <url> && cd Shttps
- bazel build //:shttps

After that, binary will be placed in {WORKING_DIRECTORY}/bazel-bin/shttps
You can alternatively run it using bazel:
- bazel run //:shttps

3. Usage:
Avalible switches are:
- document_root <path> - path which will server as a document root (base directory for your files) [default=./]
- port <number> - port on which server will work [default=80]
- interface <iface> - interface on which server will be exposed (e.g. lo, eth0, wlan0) [default=all]
- timeout <number> - number of seconds which server will wait in case of client inactivity
- v <0-3> - logging verbosity
- logtostderr <0/1> - if you would like to see messages live on screen instead of logging them to file set this flag to 1
- log_dir <path> - path where logs will be saved
